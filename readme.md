# Linear regression predecting houses' prices in King's county

This is a school project.

In this project, I used the [king's county houses prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/), which I found on kaggle to predict future houses' prices.

I had to use a **linear regression**, and even though I know it isn't the best model, I was able to get nice results with polynomial features and feature engineering.

The main.ipynb file, in which I have my models, is a bit messy at the end because I tried to make a SHAP graph.
